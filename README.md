# Restaurant-Bill-Splitter 1.0.0
### Description
Simple calculator program that computes the amount each member of a dining party is responsible for according to total bill, number of orders per member, and party size.
<br><br>
The program integrates the idea of "double-entry bookkeeping", in which the user is prompted to enter the total bill at the start of the run. After providing all bill information such as price of orders, sales tax, and tips, the program both displays the calculated grand total and the provided grand total at the beginning of the run, allowing the user to double-check the total and check for any input mistakes when appropriate.
